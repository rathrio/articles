This is a guide to planning an academic paper. It was provided by Franz
Andres Morrissey and Margaret Mace-Tessler from the [English Department][0] of
the Univerity of Berne. Before starting to write your paper, you should answer
the following questions:

1. **Topic**
*What precisely* am I going to write about?

2. **Point to make/Question/Issue/Thesis/**
*What* will I *argue/demonstrate*? What is *my point*?

3. **Importance/Relevance**
*Why* is this point important? In what way does it contribute to the
understanding of the work or linguistic phenomenon?

4. **Textual Material/Data**
*Which texts/passages/aspects* am I going to focus on for my paper?
*Why* this selection?

5. **Method**
*What* am I going to *do* with the Textual Material/Data? What *theory*, if any, will I apply?

6. **Evidence**
*What* do I know/have I found out to *support my point/thesis*?

7. **Structure**
In *what order* am I going to present my Evidence?

8. **References**
What kind of *background texts* I will I use for my paper?
